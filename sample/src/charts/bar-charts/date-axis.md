You can scale the date axis of your Kendo UI Bar Chart to get a better visualization of seasonal data in your app. This can be done by modifying:

-The base date unit of the x-axis through the categoryAxis.baseUnit attribute, which takes seconds, minutes, hours, days, week, months and years.

-The default aggregates of the series through the series -> aggregate chart setting, which takes max, min, sum, avg and count.
