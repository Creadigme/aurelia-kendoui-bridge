Logarithmic axis is a special numeric axis that transforms the actual values by using a logarithmic function with a particular base. Logarithmic axis is helpful for displaying values that cover different orders of magnitude because it lets large values display together with small values in a more condensed scale than the default linear axis.

This demo shows how you can use a logarithmic axis for the Kendo UI Column Chart by setting the valueAxis -> type = "log" attribute value.
