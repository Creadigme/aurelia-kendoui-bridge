This example demonstrates how to show variability of data using the Error Bars feature of the Kendo UI chart. The Error bars are configured via the series -> errorBars setting and are offered for the following series types: Area, Vertical Area, Column, Bar, Line, Vertical Line, Scatter and ScatterLine.

The error bars support statistical calculations based on the series data. The supported types are [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) and [population standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation). To specify that standard error should be used, you need to set "stderr" as a value.

You can find more information in the following help article: [Error Bars](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dataviz/chart/error-bars).
