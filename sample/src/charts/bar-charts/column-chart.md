The Column chart visualizes data as vertical bars whose heights vary according to their value. It can be useful for presenting a comparison between several sets of data (e.g., snapshots of data across different points in time like the GDP growth shown in this example).

Column charts are very similar to Bar charts, with the only difference that barsâ€™ orientation is vertical instead of horizontal.

You can define the chart series as horizontal via the seriesDefaults-> type ->= "column"
