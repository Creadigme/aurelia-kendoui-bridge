                    The Kendo UI chart is a data visualization widget which allows you to output a graphical representation of your data. It is useful when you would like to utilize modern browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas (with a fallback to VML for older IE versions) for interactive data visualizations. The chart supports various chart types such as area, bar, line, scatter, pie and donut, etc. as well as stock (OHLC).

                    The Box Plot chart is useful for comparing distributions between different sets of numerical data. It depicts graphically numerical data by displaying a data distribution summary with six indicators (lower value, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile, upper value) and outliers for each set of data.

                    To instantiate a Kendo UI chart, you need to specify an empty div with an id on the page, select this div with a jQuery selector and invoke the kendoChart() function. As a result, the chart is registered as a standard jQuery plugin.

                    The chart can fetch data for its series from either local or remote data source. It can also use the Kendo UI DataSource as a mediator for processing data.

                    Additional information about how to use the Kendo UI chart widget can be found in [this section](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dataviz/chart/overview) of the product documentation.
