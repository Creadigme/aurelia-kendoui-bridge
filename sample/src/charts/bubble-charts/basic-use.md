The Kendo UI chart is a data visualization widget which allows you to output a graphical representation of your data. It is useful when you would like to utilize modern browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas for interactive data visualizations. The chart supports various chart types such as area, bar, line, scatter, pie and donut, etc. as well as stock (OHLC).

A Bubble chart shows the data as points with coordinates and size defined by their items' values. It is similar to the Scatter chart, in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. This allows a Bubble chart to display three dimensional data â€” two values for the items' coordinates and one for their size. A Bubble chart is useful for visualizing different scientific relationships (economic, social, etc.). This chart type's x-axis is also numerical and does not require items.

To instantiate a Kendo UI chart, you need to specify an empty div with an id on the page, select this div with a jQuery selector and invoke the kendoChart() function. As a result, the chart is registered as a standard jQuery plugin.

The chart can fetch data for its series from either local or remote data source. It can also use the Kendo UI DataSource as a mediator for processing data.

Additional information about how to use the Kendo UI chart widget can be found in [this section](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dataviz/chart/overview) of the product documentation.
